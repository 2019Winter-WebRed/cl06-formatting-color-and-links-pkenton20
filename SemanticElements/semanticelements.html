            <p>Cats are haughty and temperamental and most of the time they act like you don't exist. On the other hand, dogs are loyal, cuddly, goofy and best of all, love you no matter what.</p>
            
            <br />
            
            <p>Out of 11 categories selected by the magazine New Scientist, dogs won six compared with five for cats. Despite cats deemed overall to have a more powerful brains, dogs showed greater ability to understand commands, problem solve and were generally more helpful, it was said.</p>
            
            <br />
            
            <p>A team of researchers at Manhattanville College in New York conducted a survey of 263 adults in the United States. 64 percent of the study participants owned a pet, and 41 percent of those owned a cat, while 53 percent owned a dog. The participants answered survey questions about their personalities and well-being. The researchers found that dog owners had a greater well-being than cat owners. Compared to cat owners, dog owners are significantly more conscientious and significantly less neurotic. Dog owners are marginally more extroverted, and they are, overall, happier than cat owners.</p>
